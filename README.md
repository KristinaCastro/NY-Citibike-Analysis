# NYC Citibike Analysis with Tableau

## Overview of Analysis:
Using Citibike bike-sharing data from the NYC Citibike program, we are creating a business proposal with visualizations in hopes of launching a similar bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. We are using NYC Citibike data for August 2019 to show investors key points from our analysis highlighting the benefits of the program and to explore the viability of the bike-sharing company in other metropolitan areas.
