# NYC Citibike Analysis with Tableau

## Overview of Analysis:
Using Citi bike bike-sharing data from the NYC Citi bike program, we are creating a business proposal with visualizations in hopes of launching a similar bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. We are using NYC Citi bike data for August 2019 to show investors key points from our analysis highlighting the benefits of the program and to explore the viability of the bike-sharing company in other metropolitan areas. 

A link to my NYC Citi bike Story in Tableau with my analysis and visualizations is below:

## Summary
The bike sharing program in NYC has shown it's a success with it's vast amount of subscribers for short, quick trips around the city. In a marketing perspective, we can target males since males use Citi bikes significantly more compared to other genders. We can further the marketing analysis by identifying key starting locations and identifying businesses, hotspots & attractions near each location that can attract our targeted audience. This program can prove to be successful in Des Moines, Iowa if the program targets the working demographic in a metropolitan area. We can further our analysis by looking into customer occupation demographic to see any trends with Citi bike usage and particular jobs and income.
